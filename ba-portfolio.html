    <div id="wtext">In the last two decades, 35% of the grass roots music venues have been forced to close, losing almost 14,000 industry jobs. the music industry in the united kingdom is 
        second only to the usa in economic terms and influence, a country five times larger...
        
        
        out of the rubble of the church, destroyed in 1945 by the luftwaffe, the sound machine rises, embodying the last musical breath of christchurch greyfriars.
        the basics of a music production / performance space are fulfilled, whilst being combined with layers of musical concepts. the interior is a musical journey, spatializing musical 
        concepts such as crescendo, tone, rhythm and timbre.
        as a building comprised of frozen sound, the proposal is both a memory of the past, and a call to the future of london’s music industry.</div>

The sound machine is an architectural proposal born out of acoustics and musical concepts.

However, new concepts of audio creation are employed, such as a ‘musical play area’ designed with a radically modular, open floor plan that encourages social and musical 
interactions between users, forging an unexpected, much needed acoustic community.
The Sound Machine is a duality of familiarity and unfamiliarity.

The programme is tailored towards aspiring musicians, regardless of experience, empowering them to push the boundaries of acoustics, inspired by the provocative proposal.
experimental synth rooms, a full size performance stage as well as mixing / recording rooms are all familiar aspects of a music production venue.
