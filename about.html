    <p>
        Having graduated with a first in ba (hons) architecture from central saint martins, i am a passionate, 
        <br>engaged and endlessly inquisitive architecture student, who works in an intuitive and creative multi-disciplinary manner, 
        <br>always eager to find new and exciting work processes that lead to innovative, thought provoking design proposals...
        <br>my foundation diploma was essential to my creative education, and afforded me the advantage of spending time making mistakes, 
        <br>inventing problems and exploring the boundaries of spatial design through experimental model making, digital creative interpretations
        <br> of space and a solid grounding in illustrative representation. 
        over the summer post-foundation, i explored synthesiser programming, 
        <br>tailoring, audio visual coding and sculpture; creating music, bespoke garments, digital coded art and metal-work sculpture, engaging 
        <br>and winning an installation competition at the chelsea physic Garden in London.
        After this, i went on to ba Architecture, using my 
        <br>accumulated knowledge and passion to investigate the boundaries of the course. i loved exploring the university, engaging both socially 
        <br>and practically with the other creative disciplines. alongside second year studies, i worked collaboratively alongside other architecture
        <br> students to design and built the fashion bA final year exhibition showcase.
        in the summer of 2022, i joined another small team of 
        <br>students on a trip to Logrono in Rioja, spain to compete with international design teams in the concentrico spatial design competition.
